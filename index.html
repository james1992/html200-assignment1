      <h3>Why Use Respnsive Web Design?</h3>

      <p>The purpose of Responsive Web Design (RWD) is to design sites that dynamically adapt their display to fit the screen size of a client device.  In this way there can be multiple website “layouts and displays”.  If the client device is a desktop computer, the user will view one site layout while if they open the same site on their smart phone they will most likely see a very different layout.  Without RWD the layout would be the same on both devices and users on smart phones or tablets would need to scroll not only up and down but side to side to view content on the site.  That scrolling greatly reduces the readability and ease of use of a site. </p>

      <p>Before the advent of RWD, sites were designed around predetermined pixel heights and widths instead of implementing a fluid approach.  With the rapid proliferation of mobile devices accessing the internet web developers turned to RWD to create user friendly sites for the various types of devices on the market.  Since there is not a standard pixel size for desktop or mobile screens, sites cannot be designed for predetermined dimensions.  Sites need to adjust fluidly to the size of the client screen that is accessing the website.</p>

      <p>People are far more likely to spend more time on visually appealing and easy to use websites.  At a time when e-commerce dominates many retail markets that extra time on a site often leads to more sales and repeat customers.  With mobile devices continuing to grow in popularity, RWD is not going anywhere but will continue to be a mainstay in web development.</p>
